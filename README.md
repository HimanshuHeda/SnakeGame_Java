# 🐍 Snake Game – Java Arcade Game  

A **classic Snake Game** built using **Java** with **Swing and AWT**, featuring smooth gameplay, intuitive controls, and increasing difficulty. This project demonstrates **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts and **event-driven game development**.  

## 📌 Features  
✅ **Classic Gameplay** – The snake grows as it eats food, with increasing speed.  
✅ **Keyboard Controls** – Arrow keys to move the snake in different directions.  
✅ **Graphical Interface** – Built using **Java Swing & AWT** for smooth rendering.  
✅ **Collision Detection** – Ends the game when the snake hits itself or the boundary.  
✅ **Score Tracking** – Displays the player's score in real-time.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Java SE** – Core game logic  
- **Java Swing & AWT** – GUI rendering  
- **Event Handling** – Capturing keyboard inputs  
- **Multithreading** *(if applicable)* – Game loop execution
